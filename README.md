# FinanceTransformer

Transformer-based model in PyTorch to predict stock prices by analyzing historical data, stock volumes, P/E ratios, and S&P 500 indices. The architecture leverages attention mechanisms and linear layers, optimized for high efficiency through parallelized code execution on a multi-GPU setup. This project deepened my theoretical understanding of AI and finance while providing hands-on experience in PyTorch development and code optimization for parallel processing. 
Will perform an official training run on an Amazon EC2 instance in the future.
